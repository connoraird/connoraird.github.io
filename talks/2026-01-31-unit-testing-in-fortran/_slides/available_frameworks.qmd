## My chosen framework

The framework I tend to choose to work with is
[pFUnit](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit), because…

- Previous experience within our department.
- Open source and still being developed.
- Appears to be the most fully featured.
- Most importantly, supports unit testing MPI parallelised code.
