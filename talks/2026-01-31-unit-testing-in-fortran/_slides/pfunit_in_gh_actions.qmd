# Automated testing with pFUnit in CI (GitHub Actions)

## Automating with Docker

:::: {.r-fit-text}

To ensure a consitent environment when running pFUnit tests through GitHub
actions, one can make use of containerisation (**Docker**, in my case)…

- Within a Dockerfile…
  - Install and build depenencies.
  - Build src and test objects and executables.
  - Run all tests.
- Wrap slow changing dependencies, such as pFUnit, into a parent Dockerfile to
  be built less frequently.
- Proprietary software can be difficult to build within Dockerfiles.

for an example of this being used in practice
