In my spare time I enjoy playing
[underwater hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_hockey). I began
playing at university before graduating to the city team,
[York Octopush](https://www.yorkoctopush.org.uk/). I now train with
[Islington Underwater Hockey](https://islingtonuwh.github.io/).

I love hiking around Britain. In particular, I have been trying to walk all the
[Wainwright fells](https://www.walklakes.co.uk/hills/wainwrights.html).
