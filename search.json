    "text": "Connor Aird\n\nResearch Software Engineer Centre for Advanced Research Computing University College London\n           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a Research Software Engineer at the Centre for Advanced Research Computing, University College London and have been since June 2023. I work across a range of projects, from parallelising High Performance Fortran to developing open-source python applications. Check out my GitHub to see what I’ve been up to lately.\n\n\n\n\n\nI graduated from the University of York in 2020 with a First Class Masters Degree in Physics. My master’s dissertation focused on 1D modelling of turbulence in Tokamak fusion reactors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy playing underwater hockey. I began playing at university before graduating to the city team, York Octopush. I now train with Islington Underwater Hockey.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love hiking around Britain. In particular, I have been trying to walk all the Wainwright fells."
